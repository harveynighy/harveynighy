## A little about me
I begun coding in the first lockdown of covid where i was learning python (as you may be able to see from my repos). My inspiration started from watching Black Mirror Bandersnatch, where the guy develops a very simple multiple choice game, so that is what i built in a very simple way to play in my terminal:desktop_computer:

Recognising my passion for development i got a job as a junior web dev at a digital agency called Tann Westlake starting with no web dev experience. Since learning HTML and css i have been very eager to learn more languages such as Javascript and how to use the MERN stack for developent.

## My Experience

As i have mentioned my first language was python were i have dabbled with neural networks and machine learning using tensorflow and pytorch. I am very interested in cryptocurrency's therefor i have been building a binance crypto tracker and plan on implementing automatic technical analysis in the near future.

I have (a little) experience in developing custom themes for wordpress websites and also using a popular plug in called ACF. I am currently looking into MERN stack apps so watch out for that in the near future.
